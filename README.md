## Neat little pip workaround for install rights limited systems, just replace pyodbc with whatever packages you want as long as it's after pip install --upgrade pip

## Follow the pattern of "pip install --upgrade *YOUR PACKAGE NAME*
### using pip install --upgrade pip seems to mitigate access restricitons on some systems allowing for susbsequent packages to be installed
## It may throw an error but has worked for me in the past even after throwing an error.
